This repository for a the AI Racing League - A fun way to learn AI using the Raspberry Pi and Python powered RC-cars.  Content includes mission, documentation, concept cards and sample labs.

## Summary
The AI Racing League is a project to create fun RC-car based ways to learn the concepts around Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Our curriculum is inspired by the DonkeyCar which is a Raspberry Pi-based system built on a remote-control car chasis.  

## Concept Cards
Our cirruculim is based around building a series of concept cards that adhere to the "one concept per card" rule.  Each card is a 5.5in X 11in laminated card with questions or challenges on the front and anwers on the back.  Concept cards have three difficulty levels with different colored borders.

1. Green - Beginner
2. Blue - Intermediate
3. Black - Advanced

Students will walk into the AI Racing League and see a stack of cards.  They will pick up one card or a set of cards and work on these.  When they are done they return the cards and select another set of cards.
