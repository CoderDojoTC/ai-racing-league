# Reference Data
This folder contains three items

1. A zip file with 12 sample images for discussion (without their JSON pairs)
2. A zip file of a reference data tub - which has about 2,600 120X160 images and JSON files.  It is about19 megabytes.  We use this to demonstrate our Jupyter Notebooks.
3. A sample model file in h5 format - it is about 12M

You can use these files to test inference the model file on any laptop.  No GPU is needed!
We will be providing sample Jupyter Notebooks for

1. viewing and plotting the data - plotting angle and throttle
1. cleaning data
1. viewing the model
1. testing inference on the model with images
