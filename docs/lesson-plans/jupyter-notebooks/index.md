# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks and Basic Data Analysis

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:

1. Understand what Jupyter Notebooks are and how to use them effectively.
2. Load and inspect data from CSV and JSON files in a Jupyter Notebook.
3. Perform basic data analysis using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib.
4. Apply their knowledge to analyze data from Donkey Car projects.

## Required Materials and Preparation

- Access to a computer with Python, Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, and matplotlib installed. 
- Sample data sets from Donkey Car projects in both CSV and JSON formats.
- Previous knowledge in Python programming.

   4.2 Hands-on Activity: Donkey Car Data Analysis (150 mins)
   
   - Loading and inspecting Donkey Car project datasets
   - Performing exploratory data analysis: answering specific questions, making plots, extracting insights
   - Discussion: Sharing insights, potential improvements for the Donkey Car project based on the data

## Evaluation

Students' understanding will be evaluated through their participation in the hands-on activities and the insights they generate from the Donkey Car project's data analysis. An end-of-unit quiz will also be provided to assess their theoretical understanding and practical skills in Jupyter Notebooks and data analysis.

## Extension Activities 

- Advanced Data Analysis: Introduce students to more advanced data analysis techniques such as correlation analysis, data normalization, and pivot tables.
- Data Visualization: Teach students about more complex visualizations using libraries such as seaborn or plotly. 
- Machine Learning Introduction: Provide a brief overview of how the data they have analyzed could be used to train a machine learning model.
