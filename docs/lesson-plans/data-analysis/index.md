# Data Analysis

In these lessons, we learn how to write some basic data analysis Python programs.

In the real world, you are often given some data and people ask us **"Tell me what insights you can give me about this data."**  This forms the basis of a field
of data science called "EDA" for "Electronic Data Analysis".

For example, say you are on a project to get cars to drive using machine learning.  What insights can you derive from the sample images and driving data?
