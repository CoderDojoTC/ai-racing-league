# GPU Configuration

In this lesson, students will understand how NIVIDA GPUs are setup
and configured under Linux.  We will review the process
of adding a GPU to a PC chassis, power and cooling requirements
and the UNIX command line tools to set up, configure and test
the GPU within the PC chassis.

After the GPU is set up the students will be able to test the performance of the GPU
in building a machine-learning model using the Donkey Car software.
