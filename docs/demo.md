# Demos

Although our students love hands-on learning with our DonkeyCars, there are other aspects of Artificial Intelligence we like to discuss in our classes.  Here are some demos we use in our classrooms.

## The Teachable Machine by Google

This demo works with almost any PC that has a built-in video camera.  You give it a set of images or pictures, or sounds and you build a model that predicts what a new images our sounds might be.  This is called a "classification" model.

Much of our classroom work is centered around the hot topic of Deep Learning.  But AI is much more than just Deep Learning.  Here are a few other areas to consider.  (Taken from the book The Master Algorithm)
