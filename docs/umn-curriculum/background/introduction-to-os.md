## Introduction to Operating Systems

Welcome to the module on Operating Systems (OS) - an essential cornerstone for understanding the broader fields of Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML). This module is designed to introduce you to the basics of operating systems in a straightforward and accessible manner. It aims to provide a foundation for learners from various backgrounds, including high school students and professionals transitioning into tech. No prior expertise in computer science is required to grasp these concepts.

### What is an Operating System?
An Operating System is the software that manages all the computer hardware and software resources. It acts as an intermediary between the computer's hardware and the applications running on it. Think of the OS as a manager in an office environment, ensuring that resources such as printers, files, and applications are allocated efficiently so everything runs smoothly.

### Key Functions of an Operating System
- **Resource Management:** Manages and allocates computer resources like CPU, memory, disk space, and peripheral devices.
- **File Management:** Controls the reading and writing of data to disk and manages how files are stored, organized, and retrieved.
- **Process Management:** Handles the creation, execution, and termination of processes. A process is an executing program.
- **Security and Access Control:** Protects against unauthorized access to the system, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.
- **User Interface:** Provides interfaces such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or command-line interfaces (CLI) for users to interact with the computer.

### Types of Operating Systems
- **Batch Operating Systems:** Processes batches of jobs without manual intervention.
- **Time-Sharing Operating Systems:** Allows multiple users to access the computer resources simultaneously.
- **Distributed Operating Systems:** Manages a group of distinct computers and makes them appear to be a single computer.
- **Network Operating Systems:** Provides services to computers connected to a network.
- **Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):** Responds to input within a specific time period, crucial for real-time applications like embedded systems.

### Examples of Operating Systems
- **Microsoft Windows:** Known for its user-friendly GUI, it’s widely used in homes, schools, and offices.
- **macOS:** Developed by Apple Inc., it’s known for its sleek design and integration with other Apple products.
- **Linux:** An open-source OS that's highly customizable, making it popular among developers and in server environments.
- **Android:** Based on the Linux kernel, it’s designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.
