## Networking

For your Donkey Car to operate autonomously, it needs to communicate with your development environment, usually a PC or laptop. This involves setting up a network connection between the Raspberry Pi and your development environment.

### How to Connect Your Raspberry Pi and Computer

1. **Same Network Connection:** Ensure both devices are connected to the same Wi-Fi network.
2. **SSH into Raspberry Pi:** Use SSH for remote command line access to your Raspberry Pi from your computer.
3. **File Transfer:** Use `scp` or a file transfer application to move files between your computer and the Raspberry Pi.
