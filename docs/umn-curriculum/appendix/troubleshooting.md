Encountering and resolving common issues during setup, training, or driving:

- **Dependency Conflicts:** Use virtual environments to isolate your project and avoid conflicts between different versions of dependencies.
- **Model Performance:** If the model performs poorly, consider collecting more diverse data, increasing the amount of training data, or adjusting the model architecture.
- **Hardware Issues:** Regularly check connections, battery levels, and component integrity to ensure reliable operation of your Donkey Car.
