Configuring your training environment and parameters can significantly impact the performance of your AI model:

- **Selecting a Model Type:** Donkey Car supports multiple model architectures. Choose one that fits your project needs, for example, `linear`, `categorical`, or `rnn`.
- **Adjusting Training Parameters:** Modify parameters such as batch size, epochs, and learning rate in the `myconfig.py` file to optimize training.
- **Using a GPU:** If available, configure TensorFlow to utilize a GPU for faster training. Ensure you have the correct drivers and TensorFlow GPU version installed.
