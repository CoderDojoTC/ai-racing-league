## Track Options

In Minnesota there is a place that sells used vynil sign material.

[Billboard Tarps and Vinyl](https://billboardtarps.com/product-category/billboard-vinyl/) - We suggest you get a dark color (block or dark blue) and then tape down white edges and a yellow dashed line in the center.

## Hardware Options

Raspberry Pi 3, 4, the Nvidia Nano, the Nvdia DX2, and the Intel Mobius Neural Stick
The base DonkeyCar today uses the Raspberry Pi 3+ which has a list price of $35.  This hardware is just barly able to process images in real-time.  Small changes in lighting will throw the car off the track.  The new Raspberry Pi 4 with 4GB RAM is a new option.

The Nvidia Nano on the other hand has 128 CUDA core processors and has more than enough power to drive around a track in real time with varied lighting conditions.  This is the hardware we have used for our first generation cars in the AI Racing League.

There are also college-level autonomous driving teams that use the more expensive Nvidia DX2 hardware.
