# Welcome to the AI Racing League
*Promoting* *equity* *and* *innovation* *in* *AI* *education.*</br>
The AI Racing League is a fun way to learn AI using small computers (Raspberry Pi and Nvidia Nano), computer vision, Python, machine learning, and RC-cars. Our curriculum is inspired by the DonkeyCar and the CoderDojo mentoring system.

## Mission
Our mission is to create and deliver educational materials that will make fun AI training accessible to everyone. We place a special focus on students from disadvantaged communities including women and minorities.  We  work as a sub-project of the CodeSavvy not-for-profit organization and we adhere to their guildlines for quality and security of our students.  This means that all our volunteers have background checks and we limit the student to mentor ratios to no more than three students per mentor.  We are committed to equal opportunity mentoring.  We strive to recruit, train and retain the best mentors we can find.</br></br>
We are inspired by the CoderDojo mentoring system and their innovative use of concept cards.  We attempt to publish concept cards that provide a flexible and agile training enviornment for a wide variety of learners.
