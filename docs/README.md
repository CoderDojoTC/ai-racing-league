# Welcome to the AI Racing League
This repository for a the AI Racing League - A fun way to learn AI using the Raspberry Pi and Python powered RC-cars.  Content includes mission, documentation, concept cards and sample labs.

## Summary
The AI Racing League is a project to create fun ways to learn the concepts around Artificial Intelligence (AI).  Our curriculum is inspired by the DonkeyCar which is a Raspberry Pi-based system built on a remote-control (RC) car chasis.

## Mission
Our mission is to create and deliver educational materials that will make fun AI training accessible to everyone. We place a special focus on students from disadvantaged communities including women and minorities.  We  work as a sub-project of the CodeSavvy not-for-profit organization and we adhere to their guildlines for quality and security of our students.  This means that all our volunteers have background checks and we limit the student to mentor ratios to no more than three students per mentor.  We are committed to equal opportunity mentoring.  We strive to recruit, train and retain the best mentors we can find.
