# Python Table

At this table, we usually have a single computer
running a Python IDE.  The users come up
to the table and are invited to change a few
lines of code and see what changes the cause.

A good example is to have a Raspberry Pi running
Thonny that changes colors on an LED strip.
We use a Raspberry Pi Pico to demonstrate this.

We also have some information cards that talk about why
Python has become the preferred language of AI and Machine Learning.
