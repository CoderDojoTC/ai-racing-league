# Introduction to AI Racing League Events

## Selecting a Venue

The area should be at least a 24'x'36 room.  A school
gymnasium is ideal.  Only about 1/2 of a full-size basketball
court works well.

## Getting a Track

You should have a track that can support multiple teams
driving at the same time.

See our [Setup Track Options](../setup/track-options.md)
for details on how to create or purchase a track.

## Learning Stations

Our events have 4-6 "learning stations" where
participants can learn about the AI Racing League.

Typical tables include:

1. [Hardware Table](./hardware.md)
2. [Unix Shell Commands Table](unix.md)
3. [Python Table](python.md)
4. [Computer Vision Table](./computer-vision.md)
5. [Jupyter Notebooks Table](./jupyter-notebooks.md)
6. [GPU Table](./gpu.md)
