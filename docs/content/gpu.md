# GPU

# Design Goals
## Fast Training Times
We want students to be able to drive around a track 20 times (10 times clockwise and 10 times counterclockwise) and
generate a reasonable sized data set of 20 frames per second and 224X224 images.  We want to train with this
data set in under five minutes.  This means that we want to use a GPU card that has about 2000 CUDA cores.
## Small
## Lightweight
## Rugged
## Easy to ship to remote sites
