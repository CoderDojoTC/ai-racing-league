# Hardware
**Hardware Options:** Raspberry Pi 3, 4, the Nvidia Nano, the Nvdia DX2, and the Intel Mobius Neural Stick
The base DonkeyCar today uses the Raspberry Pi 3+ which has a list price of $35.  This hardware is just barly able to process images in real-time in ide

The Nvidia Nano on the other hand has 128 CUDA core processors and has more than enough power to drive around a track in real time with varied lighting

The Intel Mobius stick is a low-power way to do image recognition using a USB dongle to do the image processing.  It would cost $75 in additon to the Ra

There are also college-level autonomous driving teams that use the more expensive Nvidia DX2 hardware.
