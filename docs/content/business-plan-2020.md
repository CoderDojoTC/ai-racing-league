# AI Racing League Business Plan for 2020

## Summary
This business plan governs the AI Racing League for the calendar year 2020.
We are operating as a project within CodeSavvy.
CodeSavvy is a register 501C organization.
CodeSavvy's mission is to promote coding skills in youth with a focus on 
promoting mentoring and training for girls and disavantaged youth.

## Brief History
The AI Racing League was founded in the summary of 2019.  We were inspired by the viral global
DonkeyCar project.  We wondered if the DonkeyCar racing events could be used to teach AI in the classroom.
The goals of the founders
were to promote fun events that taught AI to girls and disavantaged youth.  We
recieved an initial round of $9K in funding from the Optum Technology Social Responsibility
and lauched our first event in August of 2019.  This event was done at the International School
of Minnesota and attracted members from the AI Research community, schools, educators and students.

Since August we have participated in over a dozen events promoting AI instruction.  We have trained
and initial set of approximatly 50 mentors that are familair with the use of the DonkeyCar
