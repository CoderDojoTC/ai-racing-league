# Sample College Project

Many colleges have "Senior Seminar" courses that allow students to spend time on
projects that they are interested in pursuing.  This is an outline of a sample college-level project that a team of six students will spend about 60 hours each on.

## Equipment

1. At least two Donkey Cars
2. A PC with a GPU such as a NVIDIA GeForce GTX series card.
3. A track

We can currently supply both the cars and GPU.  The school will need to purchase its own track or borrow one from a local school such as Washburn.  Optum also has a track that is not being used.  The price for a track is around $175.

## Key Learning Objectives

1. **Machine Learning Processes** - learn the basic steps of machine learning including collecting data, building a model and using the model to make predictions.
2. **Computer Vision** - learn how computer vision systems gather images
and can predict things such as throttle speed and turning from these images.  This course uses the powerful open-source Open Computer Vision Python libraries.
3. **Data Analysis** - use Jupyter Notebooks to analyze data to find bad
data and remove it from training sets.
4. **Raspberry Pi Single Board Computers** - learn how to set up and configure the Raspberry Pi Model 4 single-board computers.
5. **Motors and Servos** - learn how to control motors and servos using pulse width modulation
6. **Calibration** - learn how to calibrate PWM signals to properly set ranges for motors and servos
7. **UNIX Shell** - learn how to use the UNIX shell to set up manage your car.
8. **GPU Configuration** - learn how to set up and configure a NVIDIA GPU on a Linux operating system
9. **Generative AI** - learn to use generative AI tools to write Python code and Jupyter Notebooks.  Use generative AI to debug problems and accelerate development.

At the end of the course, students will be asked to give a presentation and demonstration to the other students in the course.

## Assessments
The student will be asked to create a GitHub repository and keep their
documentation, notebooks and code on that site.  The use of [mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org) is strongly encouraged.  Evaluators will look for signs of
high-quality documentation that could be reused by future students
in their learning and problem-solving

Students will be asked to describe the problems they had and how they
overcame these challenges.  They will also reflect on if they effectively used
generative AI to solve problems.

Students will each be asked if they would recommend working with their
teammates in the future.  Higher ratings will be reflected in the
student's course evaluations.
