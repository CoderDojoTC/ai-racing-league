# AI Racing League Glossary of Term

#### CoderDojo
An international program of over 2,300 coding clubs that uses data-driven practices to get students interested in coding.  Many of the aspects of the AI Racing League uses these same principals.

Key aspects of CoderDojo are:

* No fees for events - accessible to all
* Mentor ratios of no more than three students per mentor
* Project-based learning
* Focus on getting students to work in teams (social learning)
* Student-directed projects
* Focus on programs for girls in coding and underprivileged youth

Their main web site is: [http://coderdojo.com/](http://coderdojo.com/)

#### CoderDojo Twin Cities Python Labs

These labs are a set of free-courses to learn Python using fun turtle graphics.  There is no experience needed.

#### CoderDojo Twin Cities MicroPython Labs

These labs are a set of free-courses to learn MicroPython.  You should have a
background in Python to use these labs.  There are lessons in sensors, motors and robots.

#### CoderDojo Base MicroPython Robot

This is a $25 robot that you build and program with MicroPython.  If you are working on a project that will lead up to a full DonkeyCar, this is an ideal project to get you started.
The robot will get you familiar with concepts like PWM, motor controllers and sensors.

#### Code Savvy
Code Savvy is a not-for-profit organization with 501(c)3 status from the IRS that the AI Racing League works as a sub-project.  All the AI Racing League financials are organized under a Code Savvy program.  Donations to the AI Racing League should be done though Code Savvy donations.  Questions about Code Savvy can be sent to kidscode@codesavvy.org

#### Concept Cards
These are small laminated cards that have concepts information on them that students can learn.  The idea is one-concept per card.  See the [CoderDojo TC Guide for Authoring Concept Cards](https://www.coderdojotc.org/CoderDojoTC/designing-concept-cards/)

#### Donkey Car
This is a trademarked name of a car that is used at our events.  The name implies "ugly" so you know that they are not designed to look pretty, just functional cars with a camera on the front.

#### Electronic Speed Control
An electronic circuit that controls and regulates the speed of an electric motor. It also can reverse the direction of the motor.  Our ESC

#### Fifteen Degree Camera Angle
The angle our cameras need to point down to have a good view of the road ahead.

#### Pulse Width Modulation
The way that we control the [Electronic Speed Controller] (ESC) and the servo by sending digital square waves with a variable ratio of the width of the positive part of the square wave.

#### Tracks

We want our clubs to all have affordable but high-quality tracks that are easy to roll up and store.  Our suggestion is to find used billboard vinyl in a dark color (black or dark blue) and then use white and yellow tape to place down the lines.

#### NVIDIA Nano
This is the board we use in our cars.  They have 4GB RAM and a GPU for accelerating real-time inference.
