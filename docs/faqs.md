# AI Racing League Frequently Asked Questions

## How much does it cost?
All our events are free.

However, ff you want to build your own car you are welcome to bring these to the events.  Parts for a DonkeyCar typically run about $250 US. See our [Car Parts Lists](car-parts-list.md) for details.

## What do I have to know before I come?

Nothing!  We have material for beginners without any prior knowledge of AI.

## What car part hardware do you use?

We use mostly NVIDIA Nano and Raspberry Pi 4 for our single board computers.  We use a wide variety of RC-car engines but the [Exceed Magnet] 1/16 scale RC car is a low-cost standard.  See our [Car Parts Lists](car-parts-list.md) for details.  Typical car parts cost around $250 US.

## What GPUs do you use and how much do they cost?

We use a standard PC chassis running Lunix with a NVIDIA GPU such as a GTX 2080.  These PCs can be purchased for around $1,500.  Se our [GPU Parts List](gpu-parts.md) for details.

Please connect with [Dan McCreary on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danmccreary/) and indicate in the note you would like to start your own chapter.

## Can I get a grant to purchase hardware for our school or club?

We are working on arranging a grant application process.  The best way to start this
process is to gather a small group of volunteers that can create a sustainable club.
Include people that have a combination of fundraising, technology, education and marketing skills.
Reach out to local school administration officials to build a community of science/math and STEM educators.  Network with local companies that are trying to build local talent in AI and machine learning.

Stay tuned for details.
