# About the AI Racing League

The AI Racing League is a fun way to learn the concepts behind artificial intelligence!  We learn AI by teaching small remote-controlled (RC) cars to drive around a track autonomously.  The cars use a low-cost Raspberry Pi computer (or NVIDIA Nano) with a camera.  Students drive around the track and gather a set of images to "train" a neural network that can be used to automatically steer the car.

In addition to teaching machine learning, this course also teaches concepts like Python programming, computer vision, data science and generative AI. Our curriculum is inspired by the [DonkeyCar](./glossary.md#donkey-car) and the [CoderDojo](./glossary.md#coder-dojo) mentoring system.  We feature a wide variety of lesson plans from the 5th grade up to college-level participants.

Our secret sauce is to combine the right hardware, software, mentors and a flexible learning curriculum to create fun events that students love to participate in.
