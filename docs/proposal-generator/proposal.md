**Title:** Faculty-Sponsored Design Project Proposal

**Course Name:** EE 4951 â€“ Senior Design

**Semester:** Spring 2024

**Project Name:** AI Racing League

**Advisor name:** Dan McCreary

**Email:** Dan.McCreary@gmail.com

**Phone:** 612-625-7322


## Project Motivation and Background
The AI Racing League project aims to provide students with hands-on experience in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, and robotic control. The project will involve developing autonomous vehicles (Donkey Cars) capable of competing in a racing environment. This initiative is motivated by the increasing relevance of AI in various aspects of technology and the need for practical, real-world application skills in our graduates.

## Project Goal and Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design, build, and test autonomous racing vehicles using Donkey Cars. Students will learn to apply machine learning algorithms, computer vision techniques, and hardware control to enable these vehicles to navigate a racetrack autonomously. The objective is to prepare students for careers in AI and robotics by providing a comprehensive learning experience that includes both theory and practice.
