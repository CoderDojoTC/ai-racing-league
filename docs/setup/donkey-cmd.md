# The Donkey Command

In normal configuration, the ```donkey``` is a UNIX shell script
that is located in the bin directory of your local environment.  For
example here is a sample path to the ```donkey``` command if you
are logged into the standard AI Racing account called **arl**

```sh
/home/arl/env/bin
```

```sh
#!/home/dan/env/bin/python3
# EASY-INSTALL-ENTRY-SCRIPT: 'donkeycar','console_scripts','donkey'
__requires__ = 'donkeycar'
import re
import sys
from pkg_resources import load_entry_point

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.argv[0] = re.sub(r'(-script\.pyw?|\.exe)?$', '', sys.argv[0])
    sys.exit(
        load_entry_point('donkeycar', 'console_scripts', 'donkey')()
    )
```
